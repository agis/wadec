//! Heap types classify objects in the runtime store. There are three disjoint hierarchies of heap types:
//!
//! - function types classify functions,
//! - aggregate types classify dynamically allocated managed data,
//!   such as structures, arrays, or unboxed scalars,
//! - external types classify external references possibly owned by the embedder.
//!
//! The values from the latter two hierarchies are interconvertible by ways of the
//! 𝖾𝗑𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗇.𝖼𝗈𝗇𝗏𝖾𝗋𝗍_𝖺𝗇𝗒 and 𝖺𝗇𝗒.𝖼𝗈𝗇𝗏𝖾𝗋𝗍_𝖾𝗑𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗇 instructions. That is, both type hierarchies are
//! inhabited by an isomorphic set of values, but may have different, incompatible representations
//! in practice.
//!
//! A heap type is either abstract or concrete. A concrete heap type consists of a type use that
//! classifies an object of the respective type defined in a module. Abstract types are denoted by
//! individual keywords.
//!
//! The type 𝖿𝗎𝗇𝖼 denotes the common supertype of all function types, regardless of their concrete
//! definition. Dually, the type 𝗇𝗈𝖿𝗎𝗇𝖼 denotes the common subtype of all function types,
//! regardless of their concrete definition. This type has no values.
//!
//! The type 𝖾𝗑𝗇 denotes the common supertype of all exception references. This type has no
//! concrete subtypes. Dually, the type 𝗇𝗈𝖾𝗑𝗇 denotes the common subtype of all forms of exception
//! references. This type has no values.
//!
//! The type 𝖾𝗑𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗇 denotes the common supertype of all external references received through the
//! embedder. This type has no concrete subtypes. Dually, the type 𝗇𝗈𝖾𝗑𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗇 denotes the common
//! subtype of all forms of external references. This type has no values.
//!
//! The type 𝖺𝗇𝗒 denotes the common supertype of all aggregate types, as well as possibly abstract
//! values produced by internalizing an external reference of type 𝖾𝗑𝗍𝖾𝗋𝗇. Dually, the type 𝗇𝗈𝗇𝖾
//! denotes the common subtype of all forms of aggregate types. This type has no values.
//!
//! The type 𝖾𝗊 is a subtype of 𝖺𝗇𝗒 that includes all types for which references can be compared,
//! i.e., aggregate values and 𝗂𝟥𝟣.
//!
//! The types 𝗌𝗍𝗋𝗎𝖼𝗍 and 𝖺𝗋𝗋𝖺𝗒 denote the common supertypes of all structure and array aggregates,
//! respectively.
//!
//! The type 𝗂𝟥𝟣 denotes unboxed scalars, that is, integers injected into references. Their
//! observable value range is limited to 31 bits.
